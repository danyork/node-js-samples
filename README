This is a repo of sample files and other experiments I do while learning Node.js ( http://www.nodejs.org/ )

I'm storing it as a repo purely because: 1) I like to put everything in git; and 2) I can easily share it
between machines this way.

I am leaving it public because perhaps one of you out there may find something here interesting.
